# Fallingwater, a VR Experience of Frank Lloyd Wright's Architectural Masterpiece

Fallingwater, a home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is an architectural masterpiece that is best appreciated 
when experienced. Here are some quotes:

> Fallingwater is Wright’s crowning achievement in organic architecture and the American Institute of Architects’ 
> “best all-time work of American architecture.” - from https://franklloydwright.org/site/fallingwater/

> As Edgar [Kaufmann] Junior once said about Fallingwater, '...There are many places where conversation, 
> and Frank Lloyd Wright's work, can be studied; there is nowhere else where his architecture can be felt 
> so warmly, appreciated so intuitively. That is the beginning of wisdom. - from 
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwGz58GIFYQ

> Travel+Leisure Magazine stated that Fallingwater is "one of the 12 landmarks that will change the way 
> you see the world.” - from https://fallingwater.org/

However, if you do a Google image search on "fallingwater" (note, one word), roughly 80% of the images are of 
the exterior of the building. Truly it is an impressive piece of architecture. But what is it like to experience 
it from the inside?

With this in mind, the goal of this project is to present a VR experience of, primarily, the interior spaces. 
Pictures don’t do it justice.
